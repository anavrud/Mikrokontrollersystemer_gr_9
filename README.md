# I2C Client with AVR128DB48

This project implements an I2C client based on the AVR128DB48 microcontroller.  
It is designed to monitor multiple system parameters efficiently, including:

- **Voltage**: internal and external monitoring  
- **Temperature**: via thermistor  
- **Fan speed**: using IR diodes and phototransistors  

## Project Status

The project was partially successful in achieving its goals:  
- Voltage monitoring implemented  
- Temperature monitoring implemented  
- A reliable solution for fan speed detection was not found.
